Everything is better the boss has made a cameo
He has seen the infidel army like a prince of old
Listen to him twist her faith, he's been out there all day
Sleeping on the laurels of a face from long ago

As matters complicate, it's a terrible thing to wait
Everything is better, the boss has made a cameo
He has seen the infidel army like a prince of old
She's made the bed three times today

Each a masterpiece in its own way
And takes his name in vain
From this vantage point she is making her plans
Kiss goodbye to this your century map
She calls her future back, takes his wine from the rack

He wants a glass of water but she sweetly mouths her no
Then like an arrow she's let go, arcing from the poison beau
Everything is better, the boss has made a cameo
She has seen the infidel army like a prince of old
